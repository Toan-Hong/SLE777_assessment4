# **Bioinformatics Assignment 4**

##  Project Overview

This project involves analyzing biological datasets using RStudio to develop data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization skills.

It is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Importing files, data wrangling, mathematical operations, plots and saving code on GitHub

Part 2: Comparative genomics between *Escherichia coli* and *Saprospirales bacterium*

The overall goal is to explore biological patterns, perform quantitative analyses, and practice reproducible research workflows using R and GitHub.


##  Data files

Part 1: use 2 files "gene_expression.tsv” and “growth_data.csv” which are available from this URL*:

https://github.com/ghazkha/Assessment4.git

Part 2: use coding DNA sequences of *Escherichia coli* and *Saprospirales bacterium*, downloaded from Ensembl database:

https://asia.ensembl.org/index.html


##  How to run the code


#### *Install dependencies:*

All required R packages are loaded in the scripts, but you can install them manually if needed:

```{r}

install.packages("seqinr")

install.packages("R.utils")

install.packages("readr")

install.packages("dplyr")

install.packages("ggplot2")

```

#### *Clone this repository from GitHub:*

git clone https://github.com/Toan-Hong/SLE777_assessment4


#### *Open and run the analysis scripts in RStudio:*

Go to the cloned folder "SLE777_assessment4"

Select Assessment4_Part1_Toan-Hong.Rmd to analyse Part 1 session --> Click Run

Select Assessment4_Part2_Toan-Hong.Rmd to analyse Part 2 session --> Click Run

Click knit to generate html or pdf report.
